# Pointers-to-Functions-
A ChatGPT generated code challenge. 

Code Challenge:
Write a C++ program that defines two functions: add and subtract.           
Each function takes two integer parameters and returns the sum and          
difference of the two numbers, respectively. 
Create a function that takes two integers and a function pointer as arguments,   
and uses the function pointer to apply the specified operation to the integers. Print the result.

Hint: The function pointer can point to either the add or subtract function.  Done
